      Want to know one of the biggest mistakes bloggers make?
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing blog posts before the headlines (aka post titles).
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a headline, they have no roadmap to follow. And so their post goes
      in multiple directions, leaving readers feeling dizzy, confused and
      disoriented.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then they try to create a headline that embraces all that madness.
      Bloggers, have mercy!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to write a great blog post full of clarity, conciseness, and
      conviction, spend some time crafting a quality headline that sets a clear
      destination, lures readers in, and leaves them eager for your advice.
      <p>
      Your headline will be your map, your writing navigation system, letting
      you know which literary roads to choose and which to avoid so that readers
      reach the intended destination as easily and efficiently as possible.

      <em>Follow these 8 rules to craft your killer headline:</em>
    </header>
    <h3>
      Headline Rule #1. Pick a Mouth-Watering Topic
    </h3>
    <div>
    <p> 
     Your blog post to get opened?
    </p>
    <p> 
Then your headline must promise readers the very answer to whatever is tormenting them. The thing that keeps them up at night.
<div class="note01"> 
<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Answering the “what keeps our readers up at night?” question is how posts like Working From Home? 14 Sanity-Saving Tools (+ 35 Pro Tips) are born. More people are working remotely, but they’ve never done it before. We saw a pain point, so we addressed it.
</div>
<p> 
Your headline should not promise them a trip to the moon and back — readers are way too swift for such shenanigans. Keep the benefit specific and narrow, and readers will feel compelled to click and get the solution to what’s bugging them.
</p>
</div>    
<h3>
      Headline Rule #2. Steal from the Pros
    </h3>
    <div>
    <p>
      Okay, you’ve done your research and you know exactly what your readers need. Now it’s time to turn your topic into a killer headline.
    </p> 
    <p>
The easiest way to master the art of writing headlines? Steal.
</p>
<p>
Not in the unethical way. In the smart and efficient way.
</p>
<p>
Decades of copywriting and advertising research have revealed the types of headlines that have proven to be successful. The types of headlines that zap readers out of their info-overload comas and compel them to open. Why mess with that research?
</p>
<p>
  If you want your headlines to grab readers, stick with what works.
</p>
<p>
No, your headlines don’t need to sound like they came straight from BuzzFeed. They can reflect your voice and style.
</p>
But until you’re as skilled a writer as Jon Morrow, let the proven templates be your guide (how do you think he got so good at writing headlines?).
</p>
<p>
Blogging is hard enough, so if you have templates at your fingertips, why not use them?
</p>
<p>
The easiest templates to start with? “How to” headlines and list post headlines. They are classics and they work. In fact, 75% of Smart Blogger’s most popular posts use these formats.
