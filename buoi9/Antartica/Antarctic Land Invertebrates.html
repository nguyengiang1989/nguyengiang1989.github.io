        <p> <strong>Antarctic animals</strong>- The most abundant and best known animals from the southern continent, penguins, whales seals, albatrosses, other seabirds and a range of invertebrates you may have not heard of such as krill which form the basis of the Antarctic food web. Most of the animals of the south polar region are seasonal visitors, conditions are just too hard for most animals to live there in the winter.</p>

            Antarctic Terrestrial Invertebrates
            Antarctica's "Other" Animals

            Whereas Africa and Asia have elephants, Antarctica has 1mm midges and springtails, where they have lions and tigers, Antarctica has predatory mites and while the Arctic has polar bears, there are water bears about 0.2mm long.
            Everyone has heard of and seen many pictures of the charismatic mega fauna that lives in Antarctica, you've probably seen films and cartoons featuring them and may even have a toy version somewhere in your house.
            
            While penguins, whales, seals and other Antarctic animals are certainly especially well adapted to the difficulties of life in the Antarctic freezer, theirs is not the whole story. As anywhere else in the world, there are many other animals around that don't get anywhere near the same degree of attention, animals without backbones, the invertebrates.    </div>

                Unlike almost any other place on earth, invertebrates on land in Antarctica generally don't make their presence known. They don't buzz around your head, try to bite you or keep landing on your potato salad and taking off again. Neither do they leave slimy tracks across your path on damp days, hide in your shoes or get eaten by birds.

The main thing you would notice about Antarctic terrestrial (land) invertebrates is that they are small, very small. The largest of them is a wingless midge, Belgica antarctica at a maximum of 13 mm in length. There are only 67 species of insects recorded in Antarctica, which is absolutely nothing compared to their teeming hordes on all other continents.

Another thing that characterizes them is that they live stop-go lives according to the temperature. When it rises above freezing point, they warm up (a process that often includes defrosting) and are active for a while as long as it stays warm. When it cools down again, so they slow down, stop and possibly freeze again. The go portion of their lives typically lasts for a few hours or even less than an hour while the stop portions may last for weeks or months on end.

They may be small and hard to find, but terrestrial invertebrates in Antarctica are amongst the hardiest of its citizens living in the harshest environments, places where as recently as 30 years ago it was thought that nothing could live. Inevitably to find terrestrial Antarctic invertebrates, you have to go looking for them.

Antarctica has the smallest permanent land fauna of any continent. Whereas Africa and Asia have elephants, it has 1mm midges and springtails, where they have lions and tigers, Antarctica has predatory mites and while the Arctic has polar bears, there are water bears about 0.2mm long.

Than again all of these invertebrates also live on all of the other continents, so is there anything special about Antarctica's Invertebrates?

                In a word - Ice. All living cells are mainly water, it serves to dissolve and transport substances over short distances, and give cells bulk and shape, without it there would be no life on earth.

                Below freezing point though, that terribly useful and vital water becomes deadly. It forms sharp ice needles which grow, piercing and destroying cell membranes and killing tissues. In humans the process causes frost bite and can result in the loss of fingers and toes if you catch it fairly quickly, the loss of arms and legs or your life if you don't.
                
                The problem for invertebrates in Antarctica is that they are at the mercy of the external temperature, warming up and cooling down with the day or a chance patch of sunlight. The average temperature in Antarctica over the year is below freezing in most places, so the animals have to avoid having their tissues destroyed by those ice crystals.            </p>
