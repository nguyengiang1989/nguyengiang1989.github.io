        <p> <strong>Antarctic animals</strong>- The most abundant and best known animals from the southern continent, penguins, whales seals, albatrosses, other seabirds and a range of invertebrates you may have not heard of such as krill which form the basis of the Antarctic food web. Most of the animals of the south polar region are seasonal visitors, conditions are just too hard for most animals to live there in the winter.</p>

            Leopard Seals - Hydrurga leptonyx
        </p>
        <p>
            Named for the spotting on its underside, the Leopard Seal is one of the largest predators in Antarctica, smaller only than the killer whale.

                LEOPARD SEAL FACTS - BASICS

            </h2>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Weight: Males up to 300 kg / females 260 - 500 kg.

                Length: Males typically 2.8 - 3.3 m / females 2.9 - 3.6 m, up to 3.8m
                
                Breeding Season: Pups born on the ice usually from November to December, though may occur up to a month earlier or later. In sub-Antarctic Islands such as South Georgia the birth season is August to September.
                
                Estimated world population: - 300,000 this estimate is from 1990, low population densities of solitary animals over vast areas are difficult to estimate.
                
                Feeding & diet: A very varied diet of any animal that is small enough for them to kill and eat, which as they are so large gives a large variety of potential prey. They will eat fish, squid, penguins, other birds and the pups of other seal species. They have highly modified rear teeth which have gaps which help them to sieve out krill from the water. The great majority of prey are taken in the water., they are ambush hunters.
                
                Diving: Leopard seals are not great divers when compared to other seals, 15 minutes is the longest dive recorded, they stay close to open water not diving great distances beneath continuous ice as other seals do. They can swim in short bursts at up to 40 kmh (25 mph).
                
                Conservation status: Least concern. Protected by the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals.
                
                Distribution: Circumpolar, ranging quite widely to sub-Antarctic islands and more northern waters, more so than most Antarctic seals. They are generally found near quite open pack ice, moving north as it starts to consolidate. If seen they will generally be found hauled out on ice floes rather than land, they may be reliably found near the open water at the edge of penguin colonies during the breeding season.
                
                Predators: Killer whales, though not very frequently.

                What are Leopard Seals like?
            </p>

                Females are larger than males, leopard seals are often described as looking "reptilian" a look that comes about by having their eyes somewhat to the side of their head rather than facing forwards as do other seals, they don't really have a forehead or a pronounced snout, a very large wide mouth that is upturned at the edges completes the look. I think they look less generic reptile and more sort of dopey dinosaur.

                Don't be fooled by the look however, leopard seals are very serious intimidating predators, they are the weight of five or more men, twice as heavy as a lion or as much as a bear. They often appear more squat when hauled out of the sea onto an ice floe where they are nearly always seen, only rarely coming ashore onto land. In the sea, they appear longer, sleeker and almost snake-like in form and movements, though they swim with large fore and hind flippers. They are the second largest Antarctic seal after the Southern Elephant seal, their size is not always apparent in pictures as they are relatively longer and slimmer than other seals.            </p>
