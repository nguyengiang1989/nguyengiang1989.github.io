        <p> <strong>Antarctic animals</strong>- The most abundant and best known animals from the southern continent, penguins, whales seals, albatrosses, other seabirds and a range of invertebrates you may have not heard of such as krill which form the basis of the Antarctic food web. Most of the animals of the south polar region are seasonal visitors, conditions are just too hard for most animals to live there in the winter.</p>

            Emperor penguins have the upright and regal bearing that their name suggests. They take the dinner-jacketed formality of all penguins to its highest level and though they are able to be as awkward, gawky and get as dirty as other penguins, when they shake it all off and stand up to regain their dignity, there are few if any, more stately and elegant animals on earth.        </p>

                Average Weight: 30kg - 66lb

Average Height: 115cm - 3.8ft

Breeding Season: April - December - Emperors breed in the depth of the Antarctic winter. The average temperature is around -20°C (-4°F) falling as low as -50°C (- 58°F) and with winds that gust up to 200km per hour (124mph).

Reproduction: Emperor Penguins breed almost exclusively on sea-ice near to the coast of Antarctica, rarely on land, the breeding colonies can be up to 200 km from the open sea.

Estimated world population: - 595,000, stable.

Diet and Feeding: Emperor penguins eat mainly fish in Antarctica, krill and squid are also important parts of their diet, the relative importance of these three depend on the area they live in and what is available at the time.

Conservation status: Near threatened..

Distribution: Circumpolar, breed right up against the continent.

Predators: Leopard seals and killer whales are the main predators of adult birds, skuas prey on eggs and chicks.

                Emperor penguins are the largest of all penguin species with an average weight of around 30kg (66lb) but can be up to 40kg (88lb) and a height of approx. 1.15m (3.8ft).

They have colourful feathers around their necks and heads, though are not quite as bright as king penguins which are almost as large. There is little or no possibility of confusing the two species however as their distribution around Antarctica is very different. While king penguins are a sub-Antarctic species, being based on islands dotted around the continent, emperor penguins are animals of the deep south. They are never found together.

Emperor penguins have yellow ear patches that are "open" fading into the white of the breast feathers, whereas king penguins have orange ear patches that are "closed" by a band of black feathers. Emperor penguin chicks have distinctive plumage with a large white face patch.
