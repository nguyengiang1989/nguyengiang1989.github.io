        <p> <strong>Antarctic animals</strong>- The most abundant and best known animals from the southern continent, penguins, whales seals, albatrosses, other seabirds and a range of invertebrates you may have not heard of such as krill which form the basis of the Antarctic food web. Most of the animals of the south polar region are seasonal visitors, conditions are just too hard for most animals to live there in the winter.</p>

            Wandering Albatross - Diomedea exulans

        </p>
        <p>
            "The bird which made the breeze to blow" has the longest wingspan of any bird on the planet, wandering albatrosses live up to their name on long fishing trips of 10-20 days when they can cover 10,000 km using barely more energy than when they are sitting on the nest.    </div>

    WANDERING ALBATROSS FACTS - BASICS
            </h2>

        <div>
            <p>
                Average Weight: 5.9 to 12.7 kg, commonly 6.4  - 11.9 kg, males are typically around 20% heavier than females. Immature birds have been reported at up to 16.1 kg shortly after leaving the nest due to still having fat reserves that sustained while on the nest waiting for the adults to return. More typically fledgling albatrosses are 1-2 kg heavier than the adult birds.

Average Length: 107 - 135 cm

Wingspan: average 3.1 m (10 ft 2 inches) and up to 3.5 m, these famously have the largest wingspan of any bird, larger but unverified sizes have been reported.

Breeding Season: An unusual breeding system whereby one chick is produced every two years by pair of adults that mate for life, though around a third of pairs defer breeding beyond the one year gap. Adults return to colonies which are on sub-Antarctic islands amongst open vegetation on exposed ridges or small hills in November, eggs are laid in December and January on a nest that is a mound of vegetation held together with mud and hatch 11 weeks later.

Estimated world population: - 26,000.

Feeding & diet: The mainstay of the albatross diet is fish, squid and crustaceans which are caught at night at the sea surface or in shallow dives. They will also follow boats and ships of any type for discarded food especially fishing boats where fish offal from gutted and filleted fish may be thrown overboard.

Conservation status: Vulnerable, many populations are in a long term decline as a result of losses from longline fisheries, the slow breeding rate of these long lived birds means they are slow to recover.

Distribution: Circumpolar, usually stays in the sub-Antarctic region not venturing further south than about 60° S. 75% of the world breeding population is found in three places, South Georgia (25%), Prince Edwards Islands (40%), Crozet and Kerguelan Islands (10%). Non-breeding birds and juveniles usually spend their time north of 50° S, between there and the sub-tropics.

                What are Wandering Albatrosses like?

                The wandering albatross is a truly remarkable bird. South Georgia residents of the species have been known to make regular fishing trips that take them as far as the seas off Uruguay and southern Brazil. Round trips of thousands of kilometres over several days repeated frequently, and all to catch food for themselves and their young, these are birds that will fly 1,000 km for breakfast. Any visiting ship to the South Atlantic will almost certainly at some time be followed by one or more albatrosses, wheeling and turning around the ship, following at a distance hypnotically and silently.
 
The bird in the picture to the right is a relative juvenile recognisable by the dark wing tips. As the bird ages, the dark patches recede further to the tips of the wings, so it becomes whiter. After leaving the nest they don't return again for 5 to 7 years when they return to the island where they were born. Albatrosses mate for life and can live to be over 60 years old probably making them the animal that travels further than any other in their life-time.

The albatross is a large bird with a large chick. The chick is so large (12kg when it leaves the nest) that it takes just over 12 months to develop fully. This means that the albatross is in the same select group as king and emperor penguins in that it has a breeding cycle that stretches over 2 years.
